# Overview
In this assignment, you'll implement a singly-linked list class that is similar to classes in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). Your list class will also define an iterator, so that users of the class can iterate over all the elements of the list.

Before starting this assignment, be sure to read the [specifications](Specifications.md) for your `IntList` and `IntList::Iterator` classes. **This document describes the interface of the data structures that you'll be implementing.**.
