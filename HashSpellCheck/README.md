# Overview

For Homework 6, you used a balanced binary search tree to implement the interface for a set. This week, youâ€™ll use a hash table to implement the same interface.

Because this is the last homework, we'll give you the rest of the semester to finish. This assignment is due at 5pm on Friday, May 3. (Note however, that grutor office hours have not changed, and there won't be evening office hours after Wednesday, May 1.)
